# Static site in 1 hour
Repo for projects produced as part of attempting to reach the 1 hour mark on static site production. I encountered this requirement on a job application in April, and I failed to meet the goal. 
## Rules: 
1. Each site will be no more than 1 page. 
2. Tailwind for styling. I believe the people who claim it makes them faster.
3. AstroJS. I enjoy the workflow, I hate copy-pasting HTML if I can use a component, and React would be overkill.
4. Design untimed. I'll largely be copying existing sites, but if I do find the need or inspiration to do my own design I want to take my time.
5. My own code, but I'm not going to pretend I own it since I'm using existing reference.
6. Timeline: 5/1-5/31
